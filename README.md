## üß≠ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to understand how customers interact with an eCommerce platform ‚Äî from viewing products to purchasing ‚Äî and discover actionable business patterns.

Using real event logs, I explored:
- üßπ **Data Cleaning:** Fixing null values, removing missing brands, validating event types.
- üîç **Exploratory Analysis:** Which brands and products perform best, how users behave by hour, and how many drop off before purchasing.
- üí∞ **Revenue Insights:** Identifying top-earning brands and products.
- üë• **Customer Segmentation:** Creating an RFM model (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to find VIPs and at-risk customers.

This work replicates what a junior data analyst would perform in a real-world business environment.

## ‚ùì Business Questions Answered

1. **Event Distribution:** How are different user actions (`view`, `cart`, `purchase`) distributed?  
2. **Conversion Funnel:** What percent of users move from viewing ‚Üí adding to cart ‚Üí purchasing?  
3. **Top Products:** Which products are purchased most often?  
4. **Top Brands by Average Price:** Which brands have the highest average selling price?  
5. **Top Brands by Revenue:** Which brands drive the most total revenue?  
6. **Hourly Activity:** During which hours do purchases peak?  
7. **Customer Segmentation (RFM):** Who are the VIP, loyal, and inactive customers?

Each question was solved using SQL and visualized in Excel for clearer business communication.

## üìä Analysis & SQL Queries

---
```sql

### üßÆ Q1. How are user events distributed? (Views, Carts, Purchases)


SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) AS total_events
FROM new_project.small_file
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY total_events DESC;



Insights

Most actions are view events ‚Äî typical for eCommerce browsing.

Only ~1.6% of views lead to purchases ‚Üí potential for funnel improvement.

Marketing teams can target high-view, low-purchase categories to increase conversion.

##  üßÆ **Q2. What percent of users move from viewing ‚Üí cart ‚Üí purchasing?**

SELECT 
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM new_project.small_file WHERE event_type='view') AS total_views,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM new_project.small_file WHERE event_type='cart') AS total_carts,
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM new_project.small_file WHERE event_type='purchase') AS total_purchases;



üí° Insights

View-to-cart conversion: ~1.2%

Cart-to-purchase conversion: ~138% (repeat buyers or multiple items).

Funnel shows where users drop off ‚Äî ideal area for UX or pricing optimization.

Q3. Which are the top 10 most purchased products?

SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS purchase_count
FROM new_project.small_file
WHERE event_type = 'purchase'
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC
LIMIT 10;


üí° Insights

Samsung and Apple dominate product-level sales.

Product IDs like 1004856 & 1004767 are top sellers.

These can be featured in ad campaigns or bundles.

Q4. Which brands have the highest average selling price?

SELECT brand, ROUND(AVG(price), 2) AS avg_price
FROM new_project.small_file
WHERE event_type = 'purchase' AND brand IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY avg_price DESC
LIMIT 10;



Insights

Premium brands like Mercury and Apple show high average prices.

Indicates their luxury positioning in the market.

Helps pricing teams understand product tier gaps.

Q5. Which brands drive the most total revenue?

SELECT brand, 
       ROUND(SUM(price), 2) AS total_revenue, 
       COUNT(*) AS total_purchases
FROM new_project.small_file
WHERE event_type = 'purchase' AND brand IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;


üí° Insights

Apple generates the most total revenue (‚Çπ211,843), while Samsung leads in total purchases.

Apple‚Äôs fewer but high-value transactions show strong brand power.

Suggests upselling opportunities for mid-tier brands.

## üß† RFM Segmentation ‚Äî Understanding Customer Value

### üß© What is RFM?
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) is a marketing analytics technique used to measure customer engagement and loyalty:
- **Recency** ‚Üí How recently the customer made a purchase  
- **Frequency** ‚Üí How often they purchase  
- **Monetary** ‚Üí How much money they spend  

It helps identify **VIPs**, **loyal customers**, and **churn risks**.

---

### üßÆ SQL Query Used

```sql
WITH purchases AS (
SELECT user_id,
           COUNT(*) AS frequency,
           SUM(price) AS monetary,
           TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, MAX(event_time), (SELECT MAX(event_time) FROM new_project.small_file)) AS recency_hours
    FROM new_project.small_file
    WHERE event_type = 'purchase'
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT *,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY recency_hours ASC) AS recency_score,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) AS frequency_score,
       NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY monetary DESC) AS monetary_score,
       CONCAT(
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY recency_hours ASC),
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC),
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY monetary DESC)
       ) AS rfm_code,
       (
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY recency_hours ASC) +
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) +
           NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY monetary DESC)
       ) AS rfm_score
FROM purchases
LIMIT 100;
