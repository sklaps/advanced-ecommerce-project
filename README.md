## üß≠ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to understand how customers interact with an eCommerce platform ‚Äî from viewing products to purchasing ‚Äî and discover actionable business patterns.

Using real event logs, I explored:
- üßπ **Data Cleaning:** Fixing null values, removing missing brands, validating event types.
- üîç **Exploratory Analysis:** Which brands and products perform best, how users behave by hour, and how many drop off before purchasing.
- üí∞ **Revenue Insights:** Identifying top-earning brands and products.
- üë• **Customer Segmentation:** Creating an RFM model (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to find VIPs and at-risk customers.

This work replicates what a junior data analyst would perform in a real-world business environment.
